The primary purpose of this project is to help companies save money by improving the prediction of capacitor failures. Our main focus is to replicate the experiments conducted by last year’s group while also designing a new, but related, experiment for real-time capacitor testing. Last year’s experiment simulated aging by placing capacitors in a furnace and applying heat to accelerate the effects of time. In contrast, our real-time experiment will involve developing a test bench capable of running continuously over multiple years to observe capacitor performance under actual operating conditions.
