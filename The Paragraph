The primary purpose of this project is to help companies save money by improving the prediction of capacitor failures. To do this, we must first determine what constitutes a failure in a capacitor and identify the mechanisms by which failure occurs. Specifically, we aim to study how capacitors degrade over time, such as through heat-based degradation, and evaluate whether this method accurately represents real-world conditions. Our main focus is to replicate the experiments conducted by last year’s group while also designing a new, but related, experiment for real-time capacitor testing. Last year’s experiment simulated aging by placing capacitors in a furnace and applying heat to accelerate the effects of time. In contrast, our real-time experiment will involve developing a test bench capable of running continuously over multiple years to observe capacitor performance under actual operating conditions. Here, “real-time” means conducting longitudinal tests that track degradation as a function of time, rather than relying on accelerated methods. Creating a model of capacitor degradation is necessary because it allows us to predict performance and failure more accurately, helping companies make informed maintenance and replacement decisions. Our study will also address what kinds of capacitors are most relevant to test and how different failure modes can be characterized.
